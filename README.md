# PowerMinute

Power Minute is a social workout web app developed to connect friends by doing a one minute workout once an hour. This app was built to be mobile-first even though it isn't a native mobile app. Power Minute was the culmination of my time at Dev Bootcamp and the project was what brought together all the technologies that we learned.
