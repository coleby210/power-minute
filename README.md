# Power Minute

Power Minute was built on the idea of taking one minute breaks every hour, on the hour, to flex your power.

Whether you want to get stronger, stretch it out, or just move around - Power Minute makes it easy. We'll remind you if you want. We'll track your progress. We'll help you connect with friends. All you need to do is get up for a minute!
